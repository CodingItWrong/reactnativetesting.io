## Pre-Workshop Setup

Thank you for signing up for the workshop! Here are the steps you can go through in advance to ensure your local development environment is ready.

In part of this workshop we will be looking at Detox tests in Surely, an open-source React Native app. If you would like, you can set it up locally so you can run the existing tests and try writing your own.

To run Surely's Detox tests locally, follow the instructions in [REACT_ADVANCED_WORKSHOP.md](https://github.com/CodingItWrong/surely-expo/blob/main/REACT_ADVANCED_WORKSHOP.md)

## You're Ready!

If you reached this point and were able to see both the running app and the passing Detox tests, congratulations: you are ready for the workshop! On Wednesday, October 25th in the workshop we will take it from here. See you then!
