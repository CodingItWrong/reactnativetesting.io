Here are some more links to references where you can learn more about React Native testing:

- Tutorial: [Learn TDD in React Native](https://learntdd.in/react-native) - explores test-driven development, the practice of writing tests before you write production code
- Video: [Building for Mobile and Web with Expo, part 8](https://youtu.be/2Dd8vtfVmTs?t=1253) - an example of building out a form screen using test-driven development with React Native Testing Library. Links to the timestamp where building that screen starts

**Looking for something else?**

If there's something you'd like to learn about testing React Native and you don't see it listed here, [let me know!](mailto:hello@testdrivenreact.com) I'm always working on new resources and would love to know what folks would like to see.
