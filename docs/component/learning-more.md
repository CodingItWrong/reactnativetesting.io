# Learning More

- For more details on how to use Enzyme, check out [the Enzyme web site][enzyme].
- Jack Franklin has an excellent [video course on Testing React with Enzyme and Jest][testing-react-enzyme]. It's for React Web, but the principles apply exactly to React Native as well. The first five videos are free.
