# Setting Up Detox

These instructions will cover setting up Detox with React Native CLI. If you're using Expo, Detox does provide [instructions for using Detox with Expo](https://github.com/wix/Detox/blob/master/docs/Guide.Expo.md), but I've had inconsistent results getting it to work.

## Installing Detox

First, let's install the global Detox CLI tool:

```bash
$ brew tap wix/brew
$ brew install --HEAD applesimutils
$ yarn global add detox-cli
```

Next, we need to add Detox as a dependency to our project. Detox can use either Jest or Mocha as a test runner, but we'll use Jest since we've used it for our other types of test.

```bash
$ yarn add --dev detox
```

Now, initialize Detox in your app to get some config files set up. We specify that we'll be using Jest as the test runner.

```bash
$ detox init -r jest
```

After this, we need to add some extra config for Detox to our `package.json`. Add the following, replacing `YourAppName` with the name of the app you entered:

```diff
 {
   ...
   "detox": {
-    "test-runner": "jest"
+    "test-runner": "jest",
+    "configurations": {
+      "ios.sim.debug": {
+        "binaryPath": "ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/YourAppName.app",
+        "build": "xcodebuild -workspace ios/YourAppName.xcworkspace -scheme YourAppName -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator -derivedDataPath ios/build",
+        "type": "ios.simulator",
+        "device": {
+          "type": "iPhone 11 Pro"
+        }
+      }
+    }
   }
 }
```

## Configuring ESLint

If you're using ESLint (and you probably should be!), here are steps to set it up to recognize Detox code.

```bash
$ yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-detox
```

Then add the detox plugin and environment to your ESLint config:

```diff
   parser: 'babel-eslint',
   plugins: [
+    'detox',
     'jest',
   ],
   env: {
     'browser': true,
+    'detox/detox': true,
     'es6': true,
     'jest/globals': true,
     'node': true,
   },
```

## Smoke Test

Detox installs a sample test for you that you can tweak. If you are installing Detox into a brand-new React Native app, you can make a passing test doing the following.

First, add a `testID` prop to an element in `App.js` so Detox can find it:

```diff
   render() {
     return (
       <View style={styles.container}>
-        <Text style={styles.welcome}>
+        <Text style={styles.welcome} testID="welcome">
           Welcome to React Native!
         </Text>
```

Then open the `firstTest.spec.js` that `detox init` generated. Replace the contents with the following:

```javascript
describe('App', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    await device.reloadReactNative();
  });

  it('should show the welcome message', async () => {
    await expect(element(by.id('welcome'))).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

To run this test, start the Metro packager as usual:

```bash
$ react-native start
```

In another terminal window, build the Detox version of the binary, and run the tests:

```bash
$ detox build
$ detox test
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
