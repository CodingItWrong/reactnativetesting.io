# Unit Tests

The phrase "unit testing" is used to mean a lot of different things by a lot of different people. In this case, we're using "unit testing" to refer to tests of functions and plain JavaScript objects, independent of the React Native framework. This means that we aren't testing any components that rely on React Native.
